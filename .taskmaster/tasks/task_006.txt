# Task ID: 6
# Title: Setup Performance Optimization Features
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3, 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement performance optimization mechanisms as specified.
# Details:
Implement a dedicated ThreadPool for AI, configure SQLite in WAL mode, and set up an LRU Memory Cache. Develop a Priority Queue System for event handling.

# Test Strategy:
Benchmark performance metrics such as startup time, memory usage, and response times. Optimize based on results.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Dedicated ThreadPool for AI [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a dedicated ThreadPool to optimize AI processing.
### Details:
Create a ThreadPool class in C# to manage AI tasks efficiently. Ensure thread safety and optimal resource allocation.

## 2. Configure SQLite in WAL Mode [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up SQLite to use Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) mode for improved performance.
### Details:
Modify SQLite configuration to enable WAL mode. Ensure compatibility with existing database operations.

## 3. Develop Priority Queue System for Event Handling [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a Priority Queue System to manage event handling efficiently.
### Details:
Implement a priority queue using C# to handle events based on priority levels. Integrate with the existing event engine.

## 4. Set Up LRU Memory Cache [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement an LRU (Least Recently Used) Memory Cache to optimize memory usage.
### Details:
Develop an LRU cache system in C# to store frequently accessed data. Ensure it integrates seamlessly with existing systems.
