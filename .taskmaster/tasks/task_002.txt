# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement Event Engine Core
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the core functionalities of the Event Engine.
# Details:
Create the EventEngine class in C#. Implement methods for processing game cycles, evaluating event conditions, executing event effects, and resolving conflicts. Use Godot signals for event-driven communication.

# Test Strategy:
Unit test each method to ensure correct event processing and conflict resolution. Use mock events to simulate game cycles.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create EventEngine Class in C# [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop the foundational EventEngine class in C# for the event engine core.
### Details:
Define the EventEngine class structure, including necessary properties and fields. Ensure compatibility with Godot signals for event-driven communication.

## 2. Implement Game Cycle Processing Method [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Develop the method to process game cycles within the EventEngine class.
### Details:
Create a method to handle game cycle updates, integrating with Godot signals to trigger events. Ensure efficient cycle management.

## 3. Develop Event Condition Evaluation Method [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Implement the method to evaluate event conditions in the EventEngine class.
### Details:
Design a method to assess event conditions, using logical checks and state evaluations. Integrate with existing game state data.

## 4. Set Up Unit Tests for Event Engine Core [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3
### Description: Establish unit tests for the EventEngine class and its methods.
### Details:
Create unit tests for each method in the EventEngine class, focusing on game cycle processing, event condition evaluation, and event execution.
